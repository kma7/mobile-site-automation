1, Navigation links in href attribute are not valid links:
	http://m.svca.cc/announcements
	http://m.svca.cc/recent-messages
	http://m.svca.cc/newman
	http://m.svca.cc/hymns

	but works with '#!', like: http://m.svca.cc/#!/announcements

2, Redundant 'a' tagged element: <a class="style-scope event-list"></a>

3, Search input should trim head & tail white spaces

4, Some hymns have space in between words, i.e: "祢信實何廣大"

5, “你” & “祢” 

6, Id should be unique, instead of have same IDs for different elements. Wasted a lot of time & efforts...i.e: id='input'
